.SS SETUP FUNCTIONS
.PP
This set of functions help prepare a console to run a new TUI
(text user interface) application.
.PP
.cdef_voidfunc get_terminfo_values
.cdef_voidfunc tis_values_set bool
.sp -1
.IP
These functions pertain to the ability to query the terminfo database
for useful termcap values.
.B get_terminfo_values
initializes the terminfo environment, enabling termcap queries, and
.B tis_values_set
is simply a test to confirm that
.B get_terminfo_values
has been called.
.PP
.cdef_voidfunc start_ca_mode
.cdef_voidfunc stop_ca_mode
.sp -1
.IP
The explanation is obscure, but note that the
.B capname
string for cursor addressing is
.RB \(lq cup \(rq.
The termcap strings associated with
.BR start_ca_mode " and " stop_ca_mode
consist of several escape sequences that preserve the terminal
settings when entering
.I cup mode
and restore the settings when leaving
.IR "cup mode" .
It's a good practice to use these functions, it makes for a better
user experience.
.PP
.cts_get_screen_size
.cts_set_scroll_limits
.sp -1
.IP
The task of setting up a scrolling area is generally done once at the
beginning of a program (unless you're responding to screen-resize
messages), and is related to the screen size for the bottom scroll
limit.
